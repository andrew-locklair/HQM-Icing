# Usage
This project does not include HockeyEditor or HQMEditorDedicated. Please see https://github.com/HockeyQuestionMark to grab these DLLs for use with this application.

To utilize, make sure that HQMEditorDedicated or HockeyEditor is included (depending on if you want to use the local server or dedicated) and compile to an EXE in Visual Studio.

Make sure that the appropriate EXE file is running, then run the file you created. You should now have icing enabled.
