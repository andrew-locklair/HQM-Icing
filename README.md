# HQM-Icing
Interfaces with HockeyQuestionMark/HockeyEditor and HQMDedicatedEditor to call Icing and print to HQM chat when icing is called.

# Usage
This project does not include HockeyEditor or HQMDedicatedEditor. Please see https://github.com/HockeyQuestionMark to grab these DLLs for use with this application.

To utilize, make sure that HQMDedicatedEditor or HockeyEditor is included (depending on if you want to use the local server or dedicated) and compile to an EXE in Visual Studio.

Make sure that the appropriate EXE file is running, then run the file you created. You should now have icing enabled.
